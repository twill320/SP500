Developed a custom financial data visualization tool in Python to track and analyze market trends. By processing raw stock data and structuring it for visual output, this project provides a clear, quantitative representation of market volatility, highlighting the statistical distribution of daily price action and trading momentum.

Technical Stack:

Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas (for time-series alignment, data cleaning, and structuring OHLCV datasets)

Visualization: Matplotlib / mplfinance (for rendering the complex candlestick geometry and dual-axis subplots)

Key Features & Implementation:

Quantitative Time-Series Analysis: Built a robust data pipeline to clean and accurately map daily Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices. The candlestick methodology enables rapid visual analysis of market trends and the probability of directional price fluctuations.

Synchronized Dual-Axis Layout: Engineered a multi-panel figure that integrates a volume subplot directly beneath the primary price chart. Aligning the shares traded with daily price movements effectively illustrates the correlation between market participation and price valuation.

Data-Dense UI Design: Programmed a high-contrast dark theme with a customized grid system and precise color coding (bullish/bearish indicators) to maximize readability, ensuring that complex financial statistics are immediately interpretable.
